# netifd

This is a fork of the official **netifd** project of OpenWRT/LEDE distribution.


# Purpose

The repository is a playground for a personal project.  My goal is to provide
means of configuring a device in *Client mode* with several wireless networks.

So if this device is moved to other area with other wireless network available,
no additional reconfiguration would be required.
